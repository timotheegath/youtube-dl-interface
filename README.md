# youtube-dl-interface
Implementation of youtube-dl with an interface in Python.
##  Credits
- Credits to the [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?tab=readme-ov-file#embedding-yt-dlp) library who powers this very basic GUI.
- Credits to [PyQt6](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/) which I used to design the GUI.
